# nanos_test
Testing site and admin to show campaigns

/// Please note this readme was created for the project review only. ///

- Used software stack and UI templates

    React(v16.3.0) / Node.js (v12.13.1)
    Paper Kit React Template

- Frontend

    home page list: client/src/views/Front.js
    Admin Dashboard: client/src/views/Admin.js

- Backend (API)
 
    home page list: server/routes/api/lists.js
    Admin Dashboard: server/routes/api/admin.js

    * Implemented 2 APIs only but other api templates were not removed because they may be used later with other functions

- I added the data.json to the server folder as a monogo database dump file.
